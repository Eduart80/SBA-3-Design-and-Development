Challenges are mostly positioning and colors by using Bootstrap, in many situations it doesn't apply ar not possible
even if in my mind I have a clear picture of how it should be. 

I have come to believe that CSS is simple and gives full control.
Solutions come mostly from W3Schools, Bootstrap webpage, Google, and GeeksforGeeks
If time is on our side, a project in real life will require more time to complete a full web page 
with all these elements.
