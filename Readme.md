### Challenges:
- Challenges are mostly with positioning and colors by using Bootstrap, in many situations it doesn't apply ar not possible.
even if in my mind I have a clear picture of how it should be. 
- The combination of CSS and Bootstrap gives more power to the styling and responsiveness of the webpage.
- I do believe that CSS is simple and gives full control.
- Help for solutions comes mostly from W3Schools, Bootstrap webpage, Google, and GeeksforGeeks
In my opinion, a project like this will require more time to complete a full web page with all the elements.
