### Chalanges:
Challenges are mostly positioning and colors by using Bootstrap, in many situations it doesn't apply ar not possible
even if in my mind I have a clear picture of how it should be. 

I have come to believe that CSS is simple and gives full control.
Help for solutions come mostly from W3Schools, Bootstrap webpage, Google, and GeeksforGeeks
In my opinion a project like this will require more time to complete a full web page with all the elements.
